# SDSS_QSOs
#
# This is my final Machine Learning project in the Data Science course at John Bruyce academy (Tel-Aviv, Israel).
# The course lasted for 8 months (340 class hours), and the project was completed on January 2021.
#
# The project involves retreiving data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey databse (SDSS), and using it to train
# ML models for prediction of QSOs among the general-field celectial objects.

# For more details, see the enclosed SDSS_descrition.docx file.
