SDSS_QSOs

This is the project I've selected as final (Machine Learning) project in the Data Scientist course at John Bryce academy (Tel-Aviv, Israel).
The JB-DS course lasted for 8 months (340 class hours), and I've completed my project on January 2021.

This project involves retreiving data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey databse (SDSS), and using it to train
ML models for prediction of QSOs among the general-field celestial objects.

Here I include just the Python code I've wrote (2 files). To actually run the program, you'll need 
additional 4 Python files from SkyServer. (If needed, contact me on ovedda@gmail.com.)

For a detailed description of the project, see the enclosed SDSS_Project_Descrition.docx file.
